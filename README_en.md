A simple HTML+Python anonymous online chat room that supports AES encrypted communication. Start main.py directly.

 The front end uses [MDUI](https://mdui.org), and the back end only forwards messages. It is written in Python.

The code is relatively basic. The work of novice noob should not be sprayed by the boss.
